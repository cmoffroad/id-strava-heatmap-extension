# Id Strava Heatmap Extension

This browser extension brings a seamless integration of the [Strava Global Heatmap](https://www.strava.com/heatmap) into the OpenStreetMap [iD editor](https://www.openstreetmap.org/edit?editor=id), enhancing your mapping capabilities.

Previously, accessing this imagery required a tedious process of extracting Strava website cookies and generating a short-lived URL that expires after a week.

Fortunately, the [JOSM Strava Heatmap Extension](https://github.com/zekefarwell/josm-strava-heatmap) simplified this process.

However, due to the lack of support for custom overlays in the iD editor, users were restricted to adding the URL as a custom background.

With this extension, you gain automatic access to all Strava activities as Heatmap overlays, eliminating the need for manual URL handling.

To learn more about using the Strava Heatmap in OpenStreetMap, consult the [Strava wiki](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Strava)."
